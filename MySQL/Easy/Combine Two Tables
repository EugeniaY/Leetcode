# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Person.firstName, Person.lastName, Address.city, Address.state
FROM Person 
LEFT JOIN Address
ON Person.personId = Address.personId

# NOTES
# INNER JOIN : only input the data if from Person.personID = Address.personID
# LEFT JOIN : Person will be the base for checking, if the personID exist in Person but not in Address' personID, it will still be included but NULL
# RIGHT JOIN: Address will be the base for checking, if the personID exist in Address but not in Person's personID, it will still be included but NULL
